## Description

```
I have been working in a semi-Iranian company for the last 3-4 months
After a while, I realized that this company is constantly firing its employees and bringing in new staff
Since I worked there as a duplicator, I did not care about the connection between their programmers and I was only in contact with the project manager and the company president.
The company became suspicious because the company had boycotted Iran in most of its projects and emphasized that no trace of individuals' identities should remain.
They handed over an infrastructure project to the Duaps team, and by hiring two programmers, we started researching and phasing the project, and so on.
After a month and the end of the first phase of the project, the president of the company disappeared
After a week, Maru removed access from the Gitleb projects. Also fired from Terlo, the last month's salary was not given to any of the programmers and the Duaps team.

Well, we made it possible for the company to write projects that were mostly written for a kind of cover on money laundering activities
So at the bottom of the projects that the programmers have already written in this company, we publish them in GitHub for the use of others and also to prevent the continuation of the dirty process of this company with these projects.
Be sure to visit, you can have educational uses or even their implementation on the server and ....
